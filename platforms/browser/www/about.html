      For 100 years, Han Chiang has been pioneering affordable yet quality
      education for the benefits of its community. A non-profit institution
      steeped in the tradition of cultivating leaders of the future, HCUC is
      committed to the highest standard of excellence in teaching, learning and
      scholarships. As the first university college of communication in
      Malaysia, HCUC prides itself on the holistic education it offers through
      different programmes in Communication and Media. Our graduates shines
      through their excellent accomplishments both on and off campus, and are
      highly sought after in the corporate world. HCUC also offers distinguished
      undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in a wide range of discipline
      including Business and Management, Applied Creative Arts and Design,
      Language and Translation. We are also the first in northern Malaysia that
      offers diploma and bachelor degrees in Chinese Studies. A degree conferred
      by HCUC stands far beyond a qualification. Our industry-oriented
      programmes, coupled with our passion to nurture well-rounded graduates
      mean that a HCUC’s graduate is distinctly competent in their respective
      fields and ready to tackle any global challenges on their path. Lecturers
      in HCUC leverage on their vast industrial experience to provide
      world-class instruction for the benefit of our students. We never cease to
      innovate, learn and support one another to foster human flourishing and
      transform lives. When we equip and empower our students, we have one
      common goal in mind: To prepare them for what’s ahead so that they can
      make a difference and create positive impact to the society and the world
      beyond. In HCUC, we help you get the most out of every opportunity
      presented to you throughout your time with us. It is our aim to create
      graduates who are well rounded and highly employable, work ready and
      equipped with the ability to tackle new challenges. As HCUC moves forward
      and defines the future, we remain rooted to our history and steadfastly
      pursue future endeavours with the same perseverance and passion that has
      brought us to where we are today.
